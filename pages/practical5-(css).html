        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology 
        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control 
        in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
         
          content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
          that share the file and its formatting.

          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the 
          same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such 
          as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
          and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
          if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme 
        to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches 
        a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
