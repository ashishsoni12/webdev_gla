        <b>HTML</b> stands for hyper text markup language â€“ it is used to display web pages on the browser. 
        In order to create web pages, one should learn HTML.
        As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
        This means that we do not write programs using HTML; instead, markup language 
        is mainly used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 
        In other words, markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 4px;">
        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
        Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. 
        HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.<br>

        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout 
        and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. 
        It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<br>

        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. 
        A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With 
        the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
        Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling,
        and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML 
        tag contains different content.
