        In order to create web pages, one should learn HTML.
        As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
        This means that we do not write programs using HTML; instead, markup language 
        is mainly used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 
        In other words, markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic.

        Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. 
        HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other
