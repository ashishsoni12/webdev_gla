        <h2>What is JavaScript ?</h2>
         <p>
            JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side 
            and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and 
            CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives 
            web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript 
            that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video 
            embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.  

            Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by 
            converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.
         </p>
         <h2>Client-Side JavaScript</h2>
         <p>
            Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

            It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
            
            The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
            
            The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
            
            JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
